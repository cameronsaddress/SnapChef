## ⚠️ RISK ASSESSMENT

### Current Risk Level: 🟢 LOW
**No critical risks identified at project start**

### Monitored Risk Areas:
1. **Memory Performance** 📊
   - **Risk**: Rendering may exceed 150MB
   - **Mitigation**: PAP continuously monitoring, optimization planned
   - **Status**: Profiling tools being configured

2. **Template Complexity** 🎬
   - **Risk**: 5 templates may be too complex for timeline
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritizing Templates 1 & 4 first, can reduce scope if needed
   - **Status**: Templates prioritized by complexity

3. **Cross-Agent Integration** 🔗
   - **Risk**: Components may not integrate smoothly
   - **Mitigation**: Regular integration checkpoints planned
   - **Status**: Dependencies clearly mapped and tracked

### No Escalations Required
All risks are being actively monitored and mitigated according to plan.

## 🎯 NEXT 8 HOURS FORECAST

### Expected Completions
By Hour 8, we expect to complete **Foundation Phase** with:
- **CED**: All data models and ViralVideoEngine ready
- **OAS**: Complete overlay system with animations
- **SSI**: Photo permissions and basic save functionality
- **QAT**: Test environment and test data ready
- **PAP**: Performance baselines established

### Critical Success Factors
1. **CED delivers data models on time** → Unblocks TD1/TD2
2. **OAS completes overlay system** → Enables template development
3. **No integration issues discovered** → Keeps timeline on track

### Checkpoint 1 Preparation
At Hour 8, we'll conduct our first major integration checkpoint to validate:
